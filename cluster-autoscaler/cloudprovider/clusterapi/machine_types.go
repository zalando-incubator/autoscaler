	// ProviderID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider.
	// This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
	// This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
	// with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up login in the autoscaler compares machines v/s nodes to find out
	// machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
	// generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
	// able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queries from the k8s apiserver
	// and then comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
	// This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler  who will

	// fundamentally wrong with the Machine's spec or the configuration of
	// the controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
	// of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
	// spec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the
	// responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured.

	// can be added as events to the Machine object and/or logged in the
